System Thermal Meltdown at 90 F.
Please contact a service tech to fix the cooling system.  Or send in a hazmat team in a few hours.

The first call should be to building security--(512-536-1123) with a request to get in touch with building maintenance about the problem. Larry Guinn ( our main engineer) or Jack Beverly, (512-801-0557) the head of maintenance for all of the Stacy buildings, will respond.

The actual service call will be made by our new AC service company, ICON Mechanical (Ph. 512-371-8877), but since the unit is on the roof, our building people will have to give them access through the 26th floor.

Everyone should know that have a small auxiliary unit operating in the serve room that can be adjusted a bit lower in the case of an emergency until the problem with the main unit can be solved.

Happy
